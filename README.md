# tdd-truffle
### This Boilerplate code that I have made can be used by anyone looking to make quick dev iterations with frontend and backend(using Ethereum)
## Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>node.js(12+)</li>
  <li>truffle</li>
  <li>yarn</li>
  </ul>
  

## Backend Setup:
1. `yarn setup`
2. `yarn test-all` (runs all tests, run in different terminal)
3. `yarn test-deploy` (checks if contract can be deployed, run in different terminal)

** Note that the contract name is newcon, and if additional contracts are to be deployed, include it in the 2_deploy_contracts.js file **

## Frontend Setup:
1. `cd app/`
2. `yarn start`
